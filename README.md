# python-basics-for-ai

This repository contains my Python learning journey focused on building a **strong and practical foundation for AI and Agentic AI**.

Instead of covering all Python concepts, this repo includes **only what is commonly used in real AI workflows**, such as prompt formatting, handling structured data, basic logic, and working with APIs.

The goal is to move efficiently from Python basics to building agent-based systems.

## Why this repository exists

Python is a large language, but most AI work relies on a small, practical subset of it.

This repository focuses on:
- Writing readable and simple Python
- Understanding how Python is used inside AI systems
- Learning by writing small, focused examples
- Avoiding unnecessary theory
